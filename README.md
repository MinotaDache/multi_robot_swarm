# Multi-Mobile Robot Autonomous Navigation and Swarming
This is ongoing project and its open for collaboration. Its objetive is to develope and implement conventional and AI enahnced autonomous navigation methods for four wheeled swarm of robots to complet a mission with autonomoy and robustness.

# Stage 1: Conventional Autonomous Navigation
Implement LiDAR-based obstacle avoidance.
Use a PID controller for goal-seeking.
Handle collision avoidance between robots.
# Stage 2: AI Enhanced Autonomous Navigation (Open Problem)
